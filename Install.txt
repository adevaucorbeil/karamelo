Installing Karamelo on Linux/MacOS:

Make sure that you have MPI installed, even though it is not really used in the code, legacy code using it was not removed. 

1. Download Karamelo and Submodules
1.1 git clone https://github.com/adevaucorbeil/karamelo.git
1.2 cd karamelo
1.3 git checkout kokkos
1.4 git submodule update --init --recursive

2. Build Karamelo to run on single CUDA GPU:
2.1 mkdir -p build/gpu
2.2 cd build/gpu
2.3 CC=gcc-12 CXX=g++-12 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA_LAMBDA=on -DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA=on build ../../

Note that you can replace 12 with the version of gcc installed on your computer. To date gcc-13 and above are not compatible with kokkos and will throw an error.

2.4 make

3. Build Karamelo to run on single CPU:
This is useful to debug the code.
3.1 mkdir -p build/cpu
3.2 cd build/cpu
3.3 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release build ../../
3.4 make

4. Enjoy!
